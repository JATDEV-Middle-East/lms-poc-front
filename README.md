# LmsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.5.

## KNOWN ISSUES
Since the purpose and scope of the project is POC:

1- No secrets management: this makes secrets and password stored in deployment, environment, Dockerfiles or even hardcoded.

2- Contributors are not available since we do not use public repositories for development purposes. This repository was created publicly to grant access to the code for the purpose of customer review only.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
